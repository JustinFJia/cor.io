# ðŸ’ƒcor&#46;ioðŸ’ƒ

cor&#46;io is a web-based choreographing tool that simplifies the song and formation selection process so choreographers can focus on what really matters - the creative process.

## Tech

cor&#46;io uses the following technologies to work properly:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - for the JavaScript backend
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web framework
- [React](https://react.dev/) - library for the frontend

## Installation

Start by cloning this repository to your desired file location.

```sh
cd <yourdesiredfilepath>
git clone https://github.com/JustinFJia/cor.io.git
cd cor.io
```

Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

```sh
node --version
```

Install all the dependencies for the frontend and backend.

```sh
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

Start the frontend and backend servers in separate terminal instances.

```sh
